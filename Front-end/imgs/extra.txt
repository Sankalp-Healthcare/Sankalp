                    <h5>Project Open house</h5>
                    <p>Every year the ECE department conducts Open house Expo for final year UG and PG students. About 250 students participate and showcase their technical and also communication skills. Projects are carried out in various fields of Electronics &amp;Communication Engineering namely Core communication, VLSI, embedded systems, Image processing, robotics, IoT, control etc. Majority of the projects are carried In-house where-as some are carried out in external organizations like ADE, LRDE, ISRO, IISc, BEL etc. Some of the projects can be rolled out as products to help in health care, military and the society in general like robots to monitor the health of senior citizens and the disabled, robots that help the injured in war, pill vending machine, detection of landmines in war zones using Ground Penetration Radar, IoT based water &amp;electricity billing system, storing and tracking of solar power, industrial pollution monitoring system, segregation of waste. Experts from various fields from industry and academia are brought to judge the projects &amp;give expert inputs. Based on the students performance, the judges have continually expressed their happiness regarding the quality of the projects and the enthusiasm of the students in explaining them. They appreciated the students for trying to analyze the need/problems of our day to day life &amp;solve them through reliable and cost effective projects. Many of the students start the work early (3rd and 4th sem) as mini-projects and continue on the same work until their final years and bring out more useful products to the society. This is a great initiative towards realizing our PMs dream of Make-In-India for creating successful young scientists &amp;entrepreneurs directly from the Institution.</p>
                    <h5>Mini Project Open house
</h5>
                    <p>Mini Project Open House Expo is a celebration of ideas, thoughts and innovation of the 1st year, 2nd year and 3rd year students, which is being conducted every semester. Students showcase their projects in the various domains like embedded systems, VLSI, Microcontrollers, Robotics and image processing etc. More than 150 projects are exhibited every semester . These projects are judged by experts from the industry and academics. It promotes out-of-the-box thinking in students and fosters interaction between juniors, seniors and professors. Its a platform where students apply their conceptual knowledge for practical applications. This bridges the gap between what we learn in the classroom and what is needed in the real world. </p>
                    <p>The projects are evaluated under 4 categories like Hardware, Software, Hybrid and Social Impact and best projects are awarded with certificates and cash prize in each category. Hardware projects are those which include electronic circuitry without any software control. Software projects are those which mainly use software tools like LabVIEW, MATLAB and programming in SQL, HTML etc., Hybrid projects are a mixture of hardware and software, i.e., all embedded applications. And Social Impact projects, as the name implies, includes all projects which aim towards the betterment of the society. This event has helped students to perform better during placements and get placed in core companies. It enriches their technical skills and soft skills. Few of the projects are further continued as a final year projects. Project expo has also resulted in publishing of papers in national and international conferences .
